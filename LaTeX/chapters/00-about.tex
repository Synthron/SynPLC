\chapter{About}

This document will describe the workings of the SynPLC.

The SynPLC is meant to be an OpenSource PLC system for home automation purposes. It can supply digital and analog IO as well as different modules for a variety of different applications, e.g. Phase-Fired Control of AC voltages. 

\section{The Origins}

This project was created of the idea that in theory one could build a LOGO!-type PLC system from Arduinos. After some research and a few failed attempts it evolved into the current state, using STM32 Microcontrollers.
